  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/logo.png
    - assets/map.png
    - assets/mimi1.gif
    - assets/mimi2.gif
    - assets/mimi3.gif
    - assets/mimi4.gif
    - assets/mimi5.gif
    - assets/mimi6.gif
    - assets/mimi7.gif
    - assets/mimi8.gif
    - assets/mimi9.gif

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Raleway
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
        - asset: lib/fonts/Raleway-Italic.ttf
        - asset: lib/fonts/Raleway-Light.ttf
          style: italic
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
